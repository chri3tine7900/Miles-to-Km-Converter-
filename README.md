# Pomodoro Timer

This is a simple Pomodoro Timer application built using Python and Tkinter. It helps you stay focused and productive by simulating the Pomodoro Technique:

* **Work Intervals:** 25 minutes of focused work.
* **Short Breaks:** 5 minutes of rest after each work interval.
* **Long Breaks:** 20 minutes of rest after every 4 work intervals.

**Features:**

* **Visual Timer:** Displays the remaining time in a clear and concise format.
* **Timer Labels:** Indicates the current phase (Work, Short Break, Long Break).
* **Progress Tracking:** Displays checkmarks for completed work sessions.
* **Start/Reset Functionality:** Allows users to start the timer and reset it at any time.

**How to Use:**

1. **Clone or Download:** Clone this repository or download the Python script.
2. **Install Tkinter:** Make sure you have Tkinter installed (`pip install tkinter`).
3. **Run the Script:** Execute the Python script.
4. **Start the Timer:** Click the "Start" button to begin the Pomodoro cycle.
5. **Follow the Timer:** Work diligently during work intervals and take short breaks as instructed.

**Customization:**

* You can adjust the `WORK_SEC`, `SHORT_BREAK_SEC`, and `LONG_BREAK_SEC` constants in the code to customize the duration of each phase.

**Note:**

* This is a basic implementation. You can further enhance it by adding features like sound notifications, customizable work sessions, and a more sophisticated user interface.

I hope this Pomodoro Timer helps you improve your focus and productivity!
